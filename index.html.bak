            construction industry has been impacted to a great extent.

Analysts and research firms are predicting steadgrowth in the coming years, yet multiple challences are hovering in the construction sector</P>

		     <h2>Challenges faced by the Construction Industry</h2>
			 
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 
			 <p><b>1. Rise in material costs:</b>
			 
			 <br>
			 <br>
              The pandemic has severely disrupted both national and international supply chains considerably and
              it will take some time before everything returns to pre-COVID levels. The cost of raw materials is
			continuously on the rise due to shortage of its supply and government imposed taxes. The main
			reason for the lack of supply is due to the disruptive supply chain. Besides, to stabilize the economymany reforms are also being introduced by the Governments. Additional cess on taxes is being
             introduced which will also lead to a rise in raw materials costs. The result is high expenses leading toa nian-value assessment of the real estate constructions.
			 
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 
			<b>2. Employee Safety:</b>
			
			<br>
			<br>
			Safety and security are now a growing concern worldwide. With COVID 19 still a threat, the most
			important challenge for construction companies is to keep their employees healthy and free of COVID
			infections on the sites. Adenuate sately measures must be adopted within the constructior
			premises. Deploying a large number of employees or construction workers may lead to
			unprecedented infection spreads; affect work deliverables, and cause delays. 
			 
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 <img class="i3" src="img4.jpg" width="200" height="100">
			 <br>
			<br> 
			  
		 <b>3. Vendor selection is harder:</b>
		 
		 <br>
		 <br>
         Because of the need of efficient and timely delivery of materials for the construction projects, there is a strong dependence on the vendors for the supply of materials and their transportation to the
		needed place. With so many options out there, it is hard to find the right vendor for the organization.
		That's why creating an extensive list of vendor selection criteria is important. One can't go into the
		vendor selection process without a solid idea of what is needed from a product or service as you will
		find yourself wasting a great deal of time and energy trying to compare different vendors.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<b>4. Ongoing Project management and Auditing is difficult:</b>
		
		<br>
	    <br>
		With the various ups and downs involved in the construction site, the main focus has been on
		completing the project in terms of details, and on time. However, in this process, accounting takes a
		backseat. Various problems make construction accounting challenging and make the project suffer
		as a result of these problems.Some of them are:<br>
		• Lack of communication<br>
		• Overhead Charges<br>
		• Payment Release and Manual Tracking<br>
		• Lack of Trust<br>
		• Inadequate Risk Management<br>
		• Limited Skills<br>
		
		
		<br>
		
		<b>5. Need of multiple clearances:</b>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		Completion of any construction demands multiple permits from various designated authorities.
		Electricity, land, services, pollution control, and environment preservation, etc are the areas where
		clearances or permits are mandatory. Even if the builders complete the construction work on time
		delays in obtaining these permits may lead to delay in handing over the projects to the clients.</p>

		<h2>How to tackle these challenges?</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>1. Vendor Sorting System:<br></b>
		     
		This is a system that will be purely based on certain parameters which will be used to determine the
		loyalty of the vendor and also the quality of the vendor overall. Parameters can be grouped into
		various categories and each category will have an average score of the parameters inside and then
		based on that we can decide which vendor to be preferred.
		
		<br>
		
		Some of the categories could be:<br>
		<br> 
		
		<b>a) Monetary:<br></b>
		It will include parameters based on the quotation submitted and credit given. It might include
		parameters like hagalina rate The amount of negotiation that can be done to get the best rate in
		comparison to the market standards), payment terms (The handling of the payment transfer and time
		given for each installment), transparency (The receipts of the payment received and procedure
		involved the payment including legal and compliance), etc.<br>
		
		<b>b) Quality:<br></b>
		
		The parameters used to measure quality will be based on vendor transparency and delivery of the
		material. Some of the parameters under this category will be like Material Report (It is about proper
		documentation against the material being supplied and its latest quality testing report i.e. around 1
		year to 2 years old, which shows that the vendor keeps the information updated on its material
		quality). Transportation Facility (transportation to be provided or will be provided and how efficient isthe transportation facility and is there any delays from the delivery time), etc.<br>
		
		<b>c) Accessibility:<br></b>
		
		This category focuses on the discipline of the vendor and also helps to judge the prolessionalism of
		the vendor. It could be measured by parameters like delivery commitment (The delivery commitment
		given is fulfilled in what ratio that is let say 80% time it is there and only 20% time the order has beendelayed, support (How easy is it to get in touch with the vendor directly or with the team to track anypending orders or discuss the quotations. Is there any digital platform or management system by
		which it is organized), etc.<br>
		<br>
		
		<b>2. Labor Management System:<br></b>
		
		This is a bigger problem in the industry and the bigger problem lies with the skilled laborers or groups
		or laborers on constant terms. Mostly the laborers can be easily found throuan the labor coniractors
		hut to kepn these labor contrartors in cherkis somptimes a harder journey.</p>
		
		
		
		<img id ="y1" src="img6.jpg" >	
		
		<p>For every project, it could be done to keep a check on the labor contractors by giving them a digital
        website link or sending them a handcrafted mail or message regarding open quotations. This is
        needed to ensure that the one we normal reter des not verme an athe same
       time get to know the market value itself. It also ensured that the ones who are currently employed will

	   <br>
	   <br>
	   
	   
	   <b>3. Site Management System</b> 
	   
	   <br>
	   <br>
	   
		also the site management itself is tedious at times. The proper reporting is not done at times and
		then it is quite difficult to control the situations which arise at a later stage as consequences due to
		the wrongdoings which have happened in the past. To make this more efficient an audit list can be
		crafted per project basis which will be done on a time-to-time basis. It can be further also digitalized
		to look into it from anywhere in the world peeds a as (he in@r nvallay can be world  <br>

Material Safety Data Sheets and are prepared for

	Various challenges have been impacting the progress of the construction industry. The need of the hour
	is to mitigate the challenges by introducing modern technologies and scaling up the labor force. By
   using the right set of technology solutions and forums, construction companies can efficiently increase
   their productivity. Along with it, it is also important for maintaining a professional reputation and most
   importantly staying profitable.</p>
